Full description:
Emotion Recognition Model with Keras

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model implemented using Keras for emotion recognition from grayscale images. The model is designed to classify images into one of seven emotion categories.

Features

Convolutional Layers: Extract spatial features from input images using multiple Conv2D layers.

Batch Normalization: Improve training stability and convergence speed.

Dropout Layers: Prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training.

MaxPooling Layers: Downsample feature maps to reduce dimensionality and computation.

Fully Connected Layers: Perform the final classification into one of the seven emotion categories.

Learning Rate Scheduling: Automatically reduce the learning rate if the validation loss plateaus.

Model Architecture

Input Layer: Accepts grayscale images of shape (48, 48, 1).

Convolutional Layers: Four Conv2D layers with increasing filter sizes (128, 256, 512). ReLU activation for non-linearity. Batch Normalization for stability. Pooling and Dropout: MaxPooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions. Dropout layers to mitigate overfitting. Fully Connected Layers: Two dense layers with ReLU activation. Regularization and dropout applied.

Output Layer: Dense layer with softmax activation for classification into 7 categories.

Training Details-

Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy. Optimizer: Adam with an initial learning rate of 0.001. Evaluation Metric: Accuracy.

Learning Rate Scheduler: Reduces the learning rate by a factor of 0.5 if the validation loss does not improve for 5 epochs. Minimum learning rate is set to 1e-6.
